# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-26)

**Core value:** Machine-specific lottery analysis with time-decay weighting -- segmenting draws by physical machine (1호기/2호기/3호기) to surface per-machine statistical tendencies
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — prediction-pipeline-vertical-slice

## Current Position

Phase: 03 (prediction-pipeline-vertical-slice) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 9 phases derived from 35 requirements with fine granularity. Backend-first build order (Foundation -> Decay -> Vertical Slice -> Full Engine -> UI -> Dashboard -> History -> Polish -> Hardening)
- [Research]: Use pandas ewm() for time decay, Strategy Pattern ABC for prediction engines, Recharts for dashboard charts
- [Phase 01]: Used asynccontextmanager lifespan pattern for data loading (not deprecated on_event)
- [Phase 01]: Sync def for data endpoint (future CPU-bound NumPy), async for health check
- [Phase 01]: Pre-filter lottery data by machine at startup into dict for O(1) lookups
- [Phase 01]: Used Tailwind v4 @theme directive for design tokens -- generates native utility classes without config file
- [Phase 01]: Used native fetch instead of axios for health check -- TanStack Query will wrap fetch in later phases
- [Phase 02]: Pure Python exponentiation for decay weights -- numpy not needed for 417 records
- [Phase 02]: DECAY_HALFLIFE=30 in config.py Settings, overridable via DecayEngine constructor
- [Phase 03]: Pure Python random.choices for weighted selection -- no numpy needed for 45-number population
- [Phase 03]: Strategy Pattern ABC (PredictionStrategy) with name/display_name/generate() contract for extensible prediction strategies
- [Phase 03]: MIN_WEIGHT_FLOOR=0.001 prevents zero-probability numbers while preserving extreme weight ratios

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Statistical honesty: Chi-square test showed no significant machine differences. Must frame as "analysis tool" not "prediction engine"
- Time decay halflife=50 is a default; needs validation via backtesting during Phase 2-3
- Composite strategy weights (30/25/20/25) are arbitrary; needs empirical evaluation during Phase 4
